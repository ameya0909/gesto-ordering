1. Added Clear Order button which deletes all food items from foods collection. 
This can be used to cancel an order by the user or to start a new order after previous order is completed.

2. Added quantity property to food items.
This can be used to enter the quantity of individual food items purchased by the customer so that user need not have
to select the same food item from the dropdown repeatedly. Also reflects in calculating the total of the order.
